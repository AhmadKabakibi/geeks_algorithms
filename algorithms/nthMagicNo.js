/* 
A magic number is defined as a number which can be expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers of 5. First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.

Write a function to find the nth Magic number.

Example:

Input: n = 2
Output: 25

Input: n = 5
Output: 130 

If we notice carefully the magic numbers can be represented as 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 etc,
where 001 is 0*pow(5,3) + 0*pow(5,2) + 1*pow(5,1). 
So basically we need to add powers of 5 for each bit set in given integer n.

time complexity O(log(n))
Space Complexity O(1)

const nthMagicNo = (n) => { 
    let power = 1; 
    let answer = 0;

    while(n != 0) {
        power = power * 5;

        //if last bit of n is set 
        if(n & 1) {
            answer += power;
        }

        //proceed to next bit 
        n >>= 1; //or n = n/2;
    }
    return answer;
}
