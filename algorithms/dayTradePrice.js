/*
* Suppose we are given an array of n integers representing stock prices on a single day.
* We want to find a pair (buyDay, sellDay), with buyDay â‰¤ sellDay, such that if we bought the stock on buyDay and sold it on sellDay,
* we would maximize our profit.
* Clearly there is an O(n2) solution to the algorithm by trying out all possible (buyDay, sellDay)
* pairs and taking the best out of all of them. However, is there a better algorithm, perhaps one that runs in O(n) time?
